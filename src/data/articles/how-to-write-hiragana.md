# How to Write Hiragana: Complete Stroke Order Guide

Learning to write Hiragana correctly is essential for Japanese language mastery. This comprehensive guide will teach you the proper stroke order, writing techniques, and tips for perfecting your Hiragana handwriting.

## Understanding Stroke Order Fundamentals

Stroke order (筆順, "hitsujun") in Japanese writing follows consistent patterns that make characters easier to write and read. These fundamental rules apply across all Hiragana characters:

1. Top to bottom (上から下へ)
2. Left to right (左から右へ)
3. Horizontal before vertical (横線から縦線)
4. Center before sides (中心から外へ)

## Basic Strokes in Hiragana

Before diving into specific characters, familiarize yourself with these basic strokes:

- Horizontal line (横線): straight left-to-right stroke
- Vertical line (縦線): straight top-to-bottom stroke
- Diagonal line (斜線): angled stroke
- Curve (曲線): flowing curved stroke
- Hook (はね): ending flick
- Dot (点): small point stroke

## Writing Tools and Setup

### Essential Materials
- Grid paper (原稿用紙)
- Sharp pencil or brush pen
- Stroke order diagram reference
- Practice sheets (downloadable templates)

### Proper Writing Posture
- Sit with straight back
- Keep paper at 15-degree angle
- Hold pencil naturally
- Maintain consistent pressure
