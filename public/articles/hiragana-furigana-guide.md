# How to Add Hiragana Above Kanji (Furigana Guide)

Learning to read Japanese kanji can be challenging, especially for beginners. Furigana (振り仮名) is a reading aid that helps learners understand kanji pronunciation by showing the hiragana reading above or beside the kanji characters. This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about using furigana effectively.

## What is Furigana?

Furigana is a reading aid consisting of small hiragana characters placed above (or beside) kanji to show their pronunciation. For example:

<ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt></ruby> (Japanese language)
<ruby>私<rt>わたし</rt></ruby> (I/me)
<ruby>食<rt>た</rt></ruby>べる (to eat)

These small hiragana characters help readers understand how to pronounce kanji characters, making Japanese text more accessible to learners and native speakers alike.

## When to Use Furigana

Furigana is commonly used in:

- Children's books and educational materials
- Texts aimed at Japanese language learners
- Newspapers (for rare or unusual kanji)
- Manga and light novels
- Official documents where precise reading is important

## How to Write Furigana Correctly

### Size and Positioning

1. **Size Ratio**: Furigana should be roughly 50% the size of the main kanji
2. **Vertical Spacing**: Maintain consistent spacing between kanji and furigana
3. **Horizontal Alignment**: Center furigana above each kanji character
4. **Length Management**: When furigana is longer than the kanji, adjust spacing evenly

### Basic Rules

- Place furigana above kanji in horizontal writing (横書き)
- Place furigana to the right of kanji in vertical writing (縦書き)
- Ensure furigana doesn't overlap with surrounding text
- Maintain consistent font size throughout the document

## Common Mistakes and Best Practices

### Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Inconsistent Sizing**: Avoid varying furigana sizes within the same text
2. **Improper Alignment**: Don't let furigana drift off-center from its kanji
3. **Unnecessary Usage**: Don't add furigana to common kanji in advanced texts
4. **Missing Readings**: Ensure all complex or unusual kanji have furigana

### Best Practices

1. **Context Awareness**: Consider your audience when deciding whether to use furigana
2. **Consistency**: Maintain the same style throughout your document
3. **Readability**: Ensure furigana doesn't interfere with line spacing
4. **Selective Usage**: Use furigana only when necessary to avoid cluttered text
